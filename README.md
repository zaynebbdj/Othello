# othello

the main difficulties we encountered were the implementation of java classes not seen in computer science classes .
Indeed knowing how to use and link the java classes between them is not easy . Other than that everything was quite simple. Too bad to have started working on the project quite late because of the endless series of tests just before the holidays. 
I did not have time to add the improved version ofExpert IA with minmax with "alpha-beta" . I think it would have been the hardest part of the project.
