# othello

Othello, also known as Reversi, is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid.


## Name
OTHELLO / REVERSI GAME

## Description
The goal of Othello is to have the majority of discs of your color facing up when the game concludes. 
The game ends when the board is full, or when neither player can make a legal move.

Players take turns placing one disc of their color on the board. To make a legal move, a player must place their disc adjacent to an opponent's disc in such a way that it "sandwiches" one or more of the opponent's discs between two of their own. The captured discs then flip to the capturing player's color.
